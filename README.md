# Breast_Cancer_Survival_EDA


0.PROJECT INTRO:
According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women each year and affecting countries at all levels of modernization (National Breast Cancer Foundation, Inc). Despite the existence of extensive evidence from controlled clinical trials and meta-analysis to support the use of systemic chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer patients, no standard regimen exists (Gianni L., et al. 2001; Hortobagyi GN et al. 2001). In clinical practice, a breast cancer patient treated with adjuvant chemotherapy should balance the costs of treatment in the form of short-term or long-term side effects, and weigh these against the benefits of treatment in reducing her risk of suffering recurrence of her cancer or death. Consequently, the fine-tuning of adjuvant chemotherapy based on prognostic factors, co-morbid illness and patient preference have become an important issue. However, number of axillary lymph node metastases is the best-established prognostic factor for localized breast cancers. This data here is running Exploratory Data Analysis to see if this data shows any association with the features available. 

DATA DESCRIPTION: This Breast Cancer survival data set contains the information about patients history and the survival after they underwent chemotherapy followed by surgery.
Attribute Information:
Age of patient at time of operation (numerical).
Number of positive auxillary nodes detected (numerical).
Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 2 = the patient died within 5 years
Objective: The objective is to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patientâ€™s age, year of treatment and the number of positive lymph nodes.
